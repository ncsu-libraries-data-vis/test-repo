# Using Git and GitHub

This document provides a workflow for creating and contributing to a new GitHub repository, specifically a repository in the [NC State Libraries Data & Vis Organization](https://github.com/ncsu-libraries-data-vis), using the Git command line tool or the application GitHub Desktop.

## Requirements

* A GitHub account (If you do not have an account, create one through the [join GitHub page](https://github.com/join)).
* Membership to the [NC State Libraries Data & Vis Organization](https://github.com/ncsu-libraries-data-vis) (Email Walt to receive an invitation).
* Git ([Git Download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) **OR** GitHub Desktop ([GitHub Desktop download page](https://desktop.github.com/)).

## Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub

The following instructions walk through the process of creating a new GitHub repository in the [NC State Libraries Data & Vis Organization](https://github.com/ncsu-libraries-data-vis). If you want to contribute to an existing repository you can skip to Step 2a, or Step 2b for instructions on using Git in the terminal or GitHub Desktop.

1. In a browser, navigate to the [NC State Libraries Data & Vis Organization](https://github.com/ncsu-libraries-data-vis).
1. Click the button labeled *New* in the upper-right corner.
1. On the **Create a new repository page** the default owner should be set to *ncsu-libraries-data-vis*.
1. Create a new repository name that is short (approximately five words or less) and descriptive. Separate each word with a dash (-). For example, the workshop "An Introduction to Programming with Python" has the repository name *introduction-to-programming-with-python*.
1. Add a short description (approximately one to two sentences) of the repository. For example, the workshop "An Introduction to Programming with Python" has the description *These materials introduce fundamental concepts of programming through the Python programming language.*
1. In most cases, the repository should be set to publicâ€“anyone on the internet can see the repository but cannot automatically commit.
1. Initialize the new repository with a:
    1. README file (This file will eventually contain an in depth description of the repository materials.)
    1. .gitignore file (If using a specific language/tool, select an appropriate template. For example, the workshop "An Introduction to Programming with Python" uses the Python template.)
    1. License (From the license options select *MIT License*.)
1. Click the button labeled *Create repository*

## Step 2a: Using Git from the terminal

## Step 2b: Using GitHub Desktop
